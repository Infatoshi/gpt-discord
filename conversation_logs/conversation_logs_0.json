Here's a basic React.js template for a simple auction marketplace:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nconst AuctionMarketplace = () => {\n  // Declare state variables\n  const [auctions, setAuctions] = useState([]);\n  const [newAuction, setNewAuction] = useState('');\n\n  // Function to handle adding new auctions\n  const handleAddAuction = () => {\n    if (newAuction.trim().length > 0) {\n      setAuctions([...auctions, newAuction]);\n      setNewAuction('');\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Auction Marketplace</h1>\n      <div>\n        <input\n          type=\"text\"\n          value={newAuction}\n          onChange={(e) => setNewAuction(e.target.value)}\n        />\n        <button onClick={handleAddAuction}>Add Auction</button>\n      </div>\n      <ul>\n        {auctions.map((auction, index) => (\n          <li key={index}>{auction}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default AuctionMarketplace;\n```\n\nTo use this template, you need to have React.js installed in your project. You can create a new React.js app using `create-react-app`, or add the above component to an existing React.js project.\n\nPlease note that this template only includes basic functionality for adding and displaying auctions. Depending on your requirements, you may need to add more features such as bidding, timers, and authentication.\n\nRemember to modify and style the template according to your specific needs and design preferences."
